Gameplay

Each player has attributes including health, strength, and attack, which determine their performance in battles.
Players attack in turns, rolling dice to determine the outcome of their attacks and defenses.
The attacker's attack value is multiplied by the outcome of their attacking dice roll to calculate damage.
The defender's strength value is multiplied by the outcome of their defending dice roll to calculate defense.
Excess damage inflicted by the attacker is deducted from the defender's health.
The game ends when one player's health reaches zero, and the other player is declared the winner.
